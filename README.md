## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 

9/10

## Self-Reflection:

To properly follow the instructions, I had to downgrade eslint to version 7 which took me some time to troubleshoot. It also wasn't clear that jest needed a script configured in order to run "npm test". Besides that, the lab went prettly smoothly. The reason I gave myself a 9 instead of 10 is because I'm not sure if I completely fulfilled the expecation of the cypress testing.

### How long it took me to finish this?

About 3 hours
